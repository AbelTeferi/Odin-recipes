    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This papaya salad is light and refreshing. I can easily eat a giant bowl of it and be completely satisfied. And as an extra bonus, this salad is pretty healthy. I sometimes add extra chiles because I enjoy a lot of heat. That's what is great about this recipe, it is easily customized to suit individual tastes.</p>
